 Simple CLI Calculator
 
Project Overview
This is a beginner-friendly Command-Line Interface (CLI) Calculator project implemented in Python. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes user input for the operation and numbers, validates the input, and outputs the result.

This project was built to practice Python fundamentals such as handling user input, using conditional statements, defining functions, and managing error handling in a simple interactive program.

Features
Supports four basic operations:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

Reads operands and operation choice from user input.

Uses if-else conditional statements to execute operations.

Provides input validation and prompts users for correct inputs.

Handles errors such as division by zero and invalid choices gracefully.

How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Download or clone this repository.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Run the script using the command:

text
python calculator.py
Follow on-screen prompts to select an operation and enter numbers.

The calculator will display the result or any input error messages.

Example Usage
text
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 3
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0
What I Learned
How to get input from users and convert strings to float for arithmetic.

Using functions to structure code and keep it organized.

Applying conditional statements (if-elif-else) for control flow.

Handling exceptions and invalid inputs for a smooth user experience.

The importance of testing edge cases like division by zero.

Gained confidence in writing Python programs that interact with users through the command line.

Future Improvements
Add support for more complex operations (exponents, modulus).

Implement continuous operation until the user chooses to exit.

Enhance input validation to handle non-numeric entries more robustly.

Build a GUI interface using libraries like Tkinter.
